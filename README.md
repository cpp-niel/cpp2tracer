# cpp2tracer

[Raytracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io), but in Herb Sutter's [Cpp2](https://github.com/hsutter/cppfront) syntax.

---

This is a reasonably faithful reimplementation of the code from the *Raytracing in One Weekend* book
using Herb Sutter's Cpp2 language syntax.

For the sake of simplicity it's all in one file and can be compiled to regular C++ syntax (Cpp1) using
the [cppfront](https://github.com/hsutter/cppfront) compiler.
